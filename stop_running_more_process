you have written a shell scripts and scheduled it to run (e.g. for every 5 minits) using crontab job and it is likely that
the process will take long time to finish and you want to stop running two or more of this script simultaneously

you give a name to your process
* * * * * exec -a PsName /Your/script.sh

and on top of  your script:

ps_count=$(/usr/bin/pgrep -f PsName -c)
if [[ $ps_count -gt 1 ]];
then
echo "process is running ..."
exit 1
fi
